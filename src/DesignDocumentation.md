## Design Documentation

Classes Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our project models a portfolio management system. There are Users, Stocks, and
a Manager. Stocks have a Value which includes the current prices as well as a
history of the prices. The manager interacts with the stocks and the users while
users can buy and sell stocks. We also created a SQL class that allows us to interact
with a SQLite database that saves our state. The remaining classes are mainly used for
the GUI.

## Design Patterns:

Singleton Pattern: ensures that only one instance of a class can exist at any given time. This pattern has been implemented in the following classes:

- Manager: This class manages all the users and transactions within the application. There can only be one instance of this class.
- SQL: This class handles the application's database interactions. There can only be one instance of this class.

Observer Pattern: allows objects to be notified of changes to the state of another object. This pattern has been implemented in the following classes:

- Market: This class represents the stock market and notifies observers (users) of changes to stock prices.
- User: This class represents a user and observes changes in the stock market to make trading decisions.
- Observer_User: This class is an interface implemented by the User class to allow it to observe changes in the Market class.

Strategy Pattern: allows algorithms to be selected at runtime. This pattern has been implemented in the following classes:

- TradeBehavior: This interface is implemented by the TradeBehavior_Buy and TradeBehavior_Sell classes, which represent the buy and sell trading behaviors, respectively. The User class selects one of these behaviors at runtime to determine how to trade.

## Classes:

### Real Objects:
- Manager: This class represents the admin that can do basically everything.
  Based on the specification, the manager can add stocks, remove stocks, update
  stocks and view users. They also have the ability to blacklist users, which prevents
  them from interacting from the system. The manager also is able to approve or deny
  both new users and users who qualify to become a super user by meeting a profit
  threshold set by the manager. The manager inherits from the Person abstract class and
  implements the Observer_User interface. This interface allows the manager to see
  live updates from the User, which then allows the manager to update their screen
  in real time.
- Person: This is an abstract class that specifies that everyone has a username, a password,
  and an email. This class also provides default methods to get and set these attributes.
- Stock: This class represents a stock. It has a name, a symbol, and a value. These are
  created by the manager and the value is updated by the manager. The stocks can then be
  bought and sold by the users.
- User: This class represents a user. They can also deposit and withdraw funds. They can buy
  and sell stocks. If they make enough profit, they can become a super user. The user inherits from
  the Person abstract class and implements the Observer_Stock interface. This interface
  allows the user to see live updates from the Stock when changed by the manager, which
  then allows the user to update their screen in real time. They also implement the User_Account
  interface which simply states some of the required methods for a user account.
- Value: This class represents the value of a stock. It has a current price and a history of prices.
  The history is used to generate a graph of the stock's price over time. The value is updated by
  the manager. As the current price is changed, the history is updated. The history is tracked
  as an ArrayList of Doubles.

### GUI Objects:
- Grapher: This class is used to create a graph of the stock's price over time. It is used by the
  Stock class to create a graph of the stock's price over time. This graph extends a JPanel so that
  it can be added to any JPanel or JFrame. This class only graphs the 10 most recent prices as those
  are the most relevant and in the database, we cannot save an ArrayList.
- Window: The window is simply a JFrame that we create to a certain size and then can update with a specific
  JPanel. This allows us to keep one window open and just update the JPanel to show different screens and titles.
- Window_Apply: This class is a JPanel that is used to apply to become a user. It also has a button to submit
  the application. This class extends JPanel so that it can be added to any JPanel or JFrame. This class
  occurs after the root page. When applicants submit, they are added to the database as a pending user.
- Window_BuySell: This class is a JPanel that is used to buy and sell stocks. It has a dropdown menu to select
  the stock, a text field to enter the amount, and a button to submit the transaction. This class extends
  JPanel so that it can be added to any JPanel or JFrame. This class occurs after the Trade page. This class
  uses the strategy design pattern because the buy and sell pages are very similar. THe only difference is that
  one buys from a global market, while the other sells from a personal portfolio. THerefore, we use TradeBehavior
  interface that allows someone to either TradeBehavior_Buy or TradeBehavior_Sell. This allows us to reuse the
  code for the buy and sell pages. When a user buys/sells, the user database is updated in OwnedStocks and the users
  balance and profit is updated in the Customers database.
- Window_EmailNotification: This is simply a window used to simulate an email notification.
- Window_Forgot: This class is a JPanel that is used to reset a password. It has a text field to enter the email
  and a button to submit the request. This class extends JPanel so that it can be added to any JPanel or JFrame.
  This class occurs after the login page. When a user submits, the database is checked to see if the email exists
  and the associated password.
- Window_Funds: This class is a JPanel that allows a user to deposit or withdraw funds. It has a text field to
  enter the amount and a button to submit the transaction. This class extends JPanel so that it can be added
  to any JPanel or JFrame. This class occurs after the main user page. Using this window changes the Customers
  table and updates the Users balance.
- Window_Login: This class is a JPanel that allows a user to login. It has a text field to enter the username,
  a text field to enter the password, and a button to submit the login. This class extends JPanel so that it
  can be added to any JPanel or JFrame. This class occurs after the root page.  People using this page are checked
  in the database to see if they are a user with the proper credentials. If they are, they are taken to the
  appropriate page.
- Window_Manager: This class is a JPanel that allows the manager to interact with the system. It has buttons
  to add stocks, remove stocks, update stocks, view users, and blacklist users. This class extends JPanel so
  that it can be added to any JPanel or JFrame. This class occurs after the login page. When the manager
  interacts with the system, the database is updated accordingly and the observers are notified.
- Window_ManagerAddStock: This class is also a JPanel that allows a user to add a stock. When added, this stock
  is added to the database and the observers are notified.
- Window_ManagerApprove: This class is also a JPanel that allows a manager to approve or deny a user. When
  approved, the user is added to the database and the observers are notified. When denied, the user is
  removed from the database and the observers are notified.
- Window_ManagerProfitTable: This is a window that allows the manager to view each users profit real and unreal.
  As the manager view the table and a user makes a profit, this table is updated in real time.
- Window_ManagerRemoveStock: This class is also a JPanel that allows a manager to remove a stock. When removed,
  this stock is removed from the database and the observers are notified.
- Window_ManagerUpdateStock: This class is also a JPanel that allows a manager to update a stock. When updated,
  this stock is updated in the database and the observers are notified.
- Window_ManagerUsers: This class is also a JPanel that allows a manager to view all users. When a user is
  selected, the manager can choose to blacklist the user. When blacklisted, the user is added to the blacklist
  table and prevented from interacting. The manager can also choose to view the users portfolio. When selected,
  the manager is able to see live updates to the user page but without the ability to interact.
- Window_Root: This is the home page. This window will generate 1 of 2 windows, one for apply and one for login.
- Window_Settings: This is also a window that allows a person to change their password and update in the db.
- Window_Stock: This is also a window that shows a stocks relevant information such as how many owned, profit, and
  a graph of the stock's price over time. This window is updated in real time as the stock's price changes.
- Window_Trade: This extends a JPanel and allows a user to buy and sell stocks. This window is updated in real
  time as the stock's price changes.
- Windoww_User: This is the main user page. This window will generate 1 of 3 windows, one for funds, one for trade,
  and one for settings. This window is updated in real time as the stock's price changes.
### SQL Schema:
#### Tables:
- Customers: This table stores all of the users information. This includes their id, name, username, password, email, balance,
  and profit. This table is used to login and to update the users balance and profit.
- EligibleSupers: This table stores all of the users that are eligible to become a super user. This table is used to
  determine if a user is a super or not. Includes username and if they are approved. If they are in the table,
  they are eligible and if in the table and approved, then they're super.
- Managers: This table stores the information for the manager. This includes email, lastName, username, password, and the minimum
  balance required to be a super user. There is only 1 manager and this table is used to login.
- OwnedStocks: This table stores all of the stocks that a user owns. This includes the symbol, ownerUsername, and purchasePrice.
  Any time a user buys or sells a stock, this table is updated. Each time a stock is added, we adjust the purchase price to
  reflect the average purchase price of all of the stock owned by the user so that when we sell, we can calculate the average
  profit. Therefore, there are multiple similar entries in the table, so when we delete, we delete only one from the table.
- PendingCustomers: This table stores all of the users that are pending approval. This table is used to determine if a user
  is pending approval. Includes all fields of a Customer but the profit and balance. If they are in the table, they are
  pending approval. Once they are approved, they are removed and added to Customers table.
- Stocks: This table stores all of the stocks on the market. An entry has a name, symbol, whether it is available,
  the current price, and the price history for the last 10 days. This is implemented because we cannot add an array
  list to the table.

### Interfaces and Helper Classes:
- Observer_Manager: This is an interface that specifies the methods that an observer must implement that is observing
  the manager. An observer must first register to the manager then will be updated when the manager changes. This is implemented
  by some manager windows.
- Observer_Stock: This is an interface that specifies the methods that an observer must implement that is observing
  a stock. An observer must first register to the manager then will be updated when the stock changes. This is implemented
  by users and windows.
- Observer_User: This is an interface that specifies the methods that an observer must implement that is observing
  a user. An observer must first register to the user then will be updated when the user changes. This is implemented
  by the manager and assorted windows of the user.
- TradeBehavior: This is an interface that specifies the methods that a trade behavior must implement. This is implemented
  by the buy and sell classes. Enables Strategy Pattern
- TradeBehavior_Buy: This is a class that implements TradeBehavior. This class is used to buy a stock. Enables Strategy Pattern
- TradeBehavior_Sell: This is a class that implements TradeBehavior. This class is used to sell a stock. Enables Strategy Pattern
- User_Account: This is an interface that specifies some of the required methods for a user account.
  This includes depositing and withdrawing funds, buying and selling stocks, and getting the
  current value of the portfolio.

## Class Structure

We designed our class structure to be as modular as possible. We have a class for each window and each window
is a JPanel. This allows us to easily add and remove windows on the same frame. We first mapped out how we wanted the program
to look and then designed the classes around that. As we were programming to an event driven model, a large
majority of our code comes from the windows. Therefore, we designed the windows to be as modular as possible so
that they can be reused in different scenarios. For example, we add a Window_BuySell class that implements
the strategy pattern so that we can reuse the same window for buying and selling. We also designed the windows
to be observers on the Manager, User, and or Stocks so that they update in real time. We also designed the
manager to be a singleton because there is only one manager. Additionally, only the sql class can modify
the database which centralized our access. Something that we would add if more time is creating a window
factory class so that we can create windows more easily.

## Scalability and Extendibility and Benfit

Scalability:
The design is scalable because it is easy to continue to add stocks and users. The entries
are just added to the database and the program will automatically update. This is done through
the use of the observer pattern. The program will automatically update the windows when the
database is updated. The program is also scalable because it is easy to add new windows. All
you need to do is create a new class that inherits from JPanel and we can add them in the flow
of the program.

Extendibility:
The design is extendible because we can add new operations to the trade behavior
as long as they implement an execute and a getName method. So if we were to add a
new type of stock such as options, we can easily add a new class that executes the
trade behavior for it.

Benefit:
By designing the program focusing on the user interaction, we are able to create a system
that is coherent and has start and end points for the user. This allows us to model the real
world closer and gives us the freedom to change and add features as necessary. The sql database
is very critical to our design because it saves our state and data and allows us to generate
the required objects quickly.
